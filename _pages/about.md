<!-- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->

Hello! I am a PhD student in the [CASH](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/CASH/) team at [LIP](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/) (ENS de Lyon, France), under the supervision of [Christophe Alias](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/christophe.alias/).

My interest are compilers and parallel paradigms. Thus, I am particularly interested in providing helpful algorithms for compilers to generate efficient code on modern parallel architectures.

My current research focus on exploring static analysis for programs manipulating sparse matrices, using the [polyhedral model](http://polyhedral.info/). It is part of the [PEPR Numpex](https://numpex.org/fr/) program.
